Based on the output, here's where each item is installed:

1.  **`curl`**:
    *   `curl` is a standard system utility. On macOS (indicated by `apple-darwin`), it's typically found in `/usr/bin/curl` or `/usr/local/bin/curl` if installed via Homebrew. The output doesn't specify an exact path but confirms it's available in your system's PATH.

2.  **`git`**:
    *   Similar to `curl`, `git` is a common command-line tool. On macOS, it's usually installed at `/usr/bin/git` (part of Xcode Command Line Tools) or `/usr/local/bin/git` if installed via Homebrew. It's available in your system's PATH.

3.  **`elan`**:
    *   `elan` (the Lean version manager) itself is installed in your user's home directory. Its executable is likely at `~/.elan/bin/elan` (where `~` is `/Users/lucas/`), and this directory is added to your system's PATH during `elan` installation.

4.  **Lean 4 (`4.11.0`)**:
    *   The Lean 4 compiler and related tools (like `lean` itself) are installed by `elan` into its managed toolchains directory:
        `/Users/lucas/.elan/toolchains/leanprover--lean4---v4.11.0`
    *   The `lean` executable specifically would be inside a `bin` subdirectory within that path (e.g., `/Users/lucas/.elan/toolchains/leanprover--lean4---v4.11.0/bin/lean`).

5.  **`Lake`**:
    *   `Lake` (the Lean build system) is bundled with the Lean toolchain. Therefore, it's installed in the same `elan`-managed toolchain directory as Lean 4.11.0:
        `/Users/lucas/.elan/toolchains/leanprover--lean4---v4.11.0/bin/lake`

6.  **Lean-related packages/libraries (`mathlib4`, `batteries`, `Qq`, `aesop`, `proofwidgets`, `importGraph`, `Cli`)**:
    *   These packages are **cloned into your current Lean project's `.lake/packages` directory**.
    *   Your current project directory is `/Users/lucas/Documents/Program_Projects/Master_2026/Logical_Verification/logical_verification_2025`.
    *   So, for example, `mathlib4` is installed at:
        `/Users/lucas/Documents/Program_Projects/Master_2026/Logical_Verification/logical_verification_2025/.lake/packages/mathlib`
    *   And similarly for `batteries`, `Qq`, `aesop`, etc., each in their respective subdirectories within `./.lake/packages/`.
