### 1. Foundational Logic Concepts

*   **Propositional Logic:**
    *   Understanding the meaning of logical connectives: implication (`→`), conjunction (`∧`), disjunction (`∨`), negation (`¬`), and equivalence (`↔`).
    *   Knowing common logical equivalences and tautologies (e.g., De Morgan's laws, distributivity, properties of `False`).
    *   Understanding `False` as an absurd proposition, from which anything can be derived (ex falso quodlibet).
*   **Definitions of Classical Axioms:**
    *   `DoubleNegation`: `¬ ¬ P → P`
    *   `ExcludedMiddle`: `P ∨ ¬ P`
    *   `Peirce`'s Law: `((P → Q) → P) → P`
    *   Understanding their interdependencies (as shown in the homework problem).
*   **Quantifiers (for list proofs):**
    *   Understanding `∀` (for all) when proving properties over lists or other types.

### 2. Lean 4 Proof Language & Tactics

This is where you translate your logical understanding into Lean code.

*   **Function Application / Lambda Calculus (`fun`):**
    *   How to define a function/proof term using `fun x y => ...`. This is the core of natural deduction in Lean.
    *   Understanding that `A → B` can be thought of as a function that takes a proof of `A` and returns a proof of `B`.
*   **Basic Introduction/Elimination Rules (Term Mode):**
    *   **Implication (`→`):**
        *   **Introduction:** `fun (hA : A) => ...` (if your goal is `A → B`, assume `hA` and prove `B`).
        *   **Elimination:** `hAB hA` (if you have `hAB : A → B` and `hA : A`, you get `B`).
    *   **Disjunction (`∨`):**
        *   **Introduction (`Or.inl`, `Or.inr`):** `Or.inl hA` (to prove `A ∨ B` using `A`), `Or.inr hB` (to prove `A ∨ B` using `B`).
        *   **Elimination (`Or.elim`):** `hAoB.elim (fun hA => ...) (fun hB => ...)` (to prove `C` from `A ∨ B`, prove `C` assuming `A`, and prove `C` assuming `B`).
    *   **Negation (`¬`) and `False`:**
        *   **Definition:** `¬ A` is `A → False`.
        *   **Elimination (`False.elim`):** `False.elim hFalse` (if you have `hFalse : False`, you can prove anything).
    *   **Auxiliary Proof Terms:**
        *   `let x : T := val`: Bind an intermediate value/proof to a variable `x`.
        *   `have h : P := proof_of_P`: Prove a proposition `P` and bind its proof to `h`.
*   **Tactic Mode (`by` block):**
    *   **`intro`**: Introduces assumptions/variables. Used for `∀` and `→`.
    *   **`apply`**: Applies a theorem or hypothesis to the current goal. Crucial for working backward.
    *   **`exact`**: Finishes a goal by matching it exactly with a hypothesis or term.
    *   **`simp`**: Simplifies the goal or hypotheses using definitions and theorems. Very powerful for unfolding definitions and basic arithmetic/list operations. You often need to tell it which definitions to use, e.g., `simp [reverse, List.append_assoc]`.
    *   **`rw` (rewrite)**: Rewrites an expression using an equality. Essential for using inductive hypotheses (`rw [ih]`).
    *   **`induction`**: The primary tactic for proving properties about inductive types (like `Nat`, `List`, `Prod`, `Sum`). You need to understand how to handle the base case (`nil` for lists, `zero` for natural numbers) and the inductive step (`cons` for lists, `succ` for natural numbers), and how to use the inductive hypothesis (`ih`).
*   **Working with `List`:**
    *   Understanding its inductive definition (`[]` for empty, `x :: xs` for cons).
    *   Knowing basic list operations like `++` (append).
    *   Familiarity with standard list lemmas (e.g., `List.append_assoc`).

### 3. Lean 4 Environment and Tools

*   **`#check`**: Invaluable for inspecting the type of terms, theorems, or definitions.
*   **Navigation (Ctrl/Cmd-click):** Allows you to jump to the definition of a type, function, or theorem in your Lean files or the standard library. This is crucial for understanding `DoubleNegation`, `ExcludedMiddle`, `Not`, `List.append_assoc`, etc.
*   **Linter Warnings:** Understanding what warnings like "unused variable" mean. They often point to redundancy but not necessarily a logical error.
*   **Goal State:** Being able to read and understand the "goal state" displayed by Lean (the current goal and available hypotheses). This is fundamental for knowing what to do next in a proof.

# Q&A

### 1. Foundational Logic Concepts

#### Q: What is implication (→) 
#### A: 
1. read as "implies" or "if...then". 
2. If A is true, then B is true. 
3. The implication A → B is considered **false** only when A is true AND B is false.

#### Q: Simply introduce common logical equivalences and tautologies (e.g., De Morgan's laws, distributivity, properties of False)
#### A:
1. Logical Equivalence (↔): Two propositions P and Q are logically equivalent if they always have the same truth value.
2. ∧: AND, ∨:OR
3. Tautology: A proposition that is always true, regardless of the truth values of its constituent propositions. Peirce's Law: ((P → Q) → P) → P

#### Q: Why :False → P (Ex Falso Quodlibet, EFQ - "From false, anything follows"): If you can prove False, you can logically deduce any proposition P. This is a tautology.

#### A:
1. False → P false can never occur, then False → P must always be true
2. regardless of what Pis. This is why it's a tautology.

#### Q: Explain ExcludedMiddle: P ∨ ¬ P, Peirce's Law: ((P → Q) → P) → P. And teach me some Classical Axioms. and help me understand their interdependencies

#### Q: What is Quantifiers (for list proofs)
#### A:
1. ∀ - "for all" or "for every"
2. ∃ - "there exists" or "for some"


### 2. Lean 4 Proof Language & Tactics

#### Q: Give me an example of Function Application / Lambda Calculus (`fun`) and what is natural deduction

#### Q: pls give me some easy examples about Basic Introduction/Elimination Rules 

#### Q: what does it mean: simp [reverse, List.append_assoc]

#### Q: what is inductive hypothesis (`ih`), what does inductive mean

#### Q: Core idea of building proofs:
#### A:
1. The core idea is that you build proofs by:
2. Starting with premises (assumptions).
3. Applying introduction rules to construct new propositions from existing ones.
4. Applying elimination rules to break down existing propositions and derive conclusions.
5. Eventually reaching your desired conclusion.
